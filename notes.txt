Player character

Keyboard input
space = jump
gravity needed jump and fall
Floor needs to be created so character won't fall

keyboard input
- pygame.key
- event loop

PYGAME.KEY:
keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
# a tuple with 0's or 1's if a button is pressed... a dictionary!
space_btn_pressed = keys[pygame.K_SPACE]
if space_btn_pressed:
    print("jump")


EVENT LOOP:
1. check if any button was pressed
2. work with a specific key

if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
    if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
        # do stuff here, like character jumping


GRAVITY
things fall exponentially, not linearlly
gravity += some value
player.y += gravity

CREATING THE FLOOR
check the y-position of the player
simulate the collision
never let player go below a certain y-value
